Majority of sexual content that is shared on foundation assets will be handled by the Moderation team on Discord, however, in alliance with them, the Ethics Committee will issue a foundation roleplay reprimand based on the severity of the infraction. When deciding on a reprimand, consider the following; what was the effect of the sexual content, who was effected by the content, what was the extent of the sexual content, criminal history, etc.
