Disturbing on-site activities is an umbrella term that can be applied to a variety of infractions that cause the status of the site to change in a negative way. For example, if an FP intentionally antagonizes an SCP during an interaction, this can possibly lead to a breach in the facility. When deciding on a reprimand, consider the following; how the disturbance affected the sites status,if the disturbance was accidental, # of previous infractions of this type, time frame between infractions of this type, etc.
