The Manufacturing Department is a major load bearing pillar within the community which works alongside the Founders. The Manufacturing Department is special, as unlike other departments within the Foundation this department is not a role play driven department. Rather the Manufacturing Department materializes the requests of the Foundation, for the Foundation.

Each and every member of the Manufacturing Department has an obligation to the community and responsibility to ensure we upkeep our promises to the community while also maintaining good relation.
