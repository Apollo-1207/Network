The Manufacturing Department structure differs from that of others within the foundation. The ranks within the Department do not directly equate to clearance levels. **As a baseline, all developers must hold at least a clearance of Level 2.** This is done for security, logistical, and ethical reasons. The Manufacturing Structure is as follows:

---

The founders are responsible for the oversight of the Manufacturing Department, and often then not serve as the Technical Site Director.
