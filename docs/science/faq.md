No, as long as it follows the Code of Ethics, Guidelines, and your current ranking permits testing on desired SCPs.

Assistant Researcher+ may utilize the hazmat suits while hosting or spectating a test on an SCP which has the possibility to breach outside of its containment, that being 008 and 409 as of now. Additionally, Assistant Researcher+ may utilize the hazmat suits during a containment breach to minimize the spread of infection.
