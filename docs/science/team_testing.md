### What is Team Testing
Team Testing is the same as a normal test however rather than the test being hosted by one singular individual. The test will be hosted by a collaborative effort of 2-4 researchers working together. However there are certain expectations and rules that must be met and followed.
:::info
Make sure you read and understand all rules and expectations of doing a Team Test.
:::

### How does it Work
Team Testing is similar to a standard test, the only difference is that you work together with a group of up to 4 people to do a test report. You will work together to come up with question and report for grading. When you do a Team Test, you are required to write a report for grading. Once you have submitted your report, it will be graded and each member of the test will be rewarded with points.

### Rules and Expectations
- Test must be performed on a Public Server.
- Everyone must follow guidelines and CoE.
-Must log one singular report for the entire group.
- The test must be within host limitations (The member with the lowest rank). 
:::info Clarification
If you have an AR and 2 JR, you must use the restrictions of the AR who has the lowest rank within the group.

:::danger NOTICE
You are required to send only ONE test report upon completion of the test.
