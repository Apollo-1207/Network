**SCP-1162, also known as "A Hole in the Wall"**, appears to be an ordinary concave hole in a wall of solid concrete that shows no anomalous properties when undisturbed. Once a subject approaches the hole, a lengthy black arm of about 7 feet in length extend out; the hand outstreched in a splayed manner. SCP-1162 has been witnessed to slowly retract the entirety of it's arm, and at other times disappear in a "poof" of smoke. If a subject gives/places an object into the hands, the arm will then retract into the hole and will return after a few seconds with a new or same item. SCP-1162 has been seen to "gift" subjects mostly weapons, but some items given to SCP-1162 may prove to differ in results.
