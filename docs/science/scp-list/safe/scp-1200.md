**SCP 1200 also known as “Tastes Like Chewing Gum”** is composed of 6 known packages of anomalous gums, that if consumed, give a subject certain anomalous properties related to their name (for instance, the gum “Tastes like ghost” makes its consumer translucid, just like a ghost). These gums cannot be “carried” and are to be clicked while they lie on the table they are currently placed. As of now, no gums seem to kill/harm their consumer, although this may change with future additions/fixes.

SCP 1200-29, also known as “Rainbow gum” is another harmless instance of 1200. If consumed, the subject will shrink and its body will deform into bizarre proportions. These effects do not damage the subject and no other physical changes aside from deformation seem to take place.

The red instance of SCP 1200 makes anyone who consumes it somewhat translucent (although to a point where the naked eye can see said subject). The effects don’t seem to wear down nor to damage the subject under the effects of said gum.

<summary>SCP-1200-15 "Taste like Sunshine" [ Yellow Gum ]</summary>

The yellow gum is another instance of SCP 1200. Subjects who consume it start to emit intense white light, almost to a degree where the subject itself cannot be seen by other people staring at him. The gum’s effects seem to wear down if the red gum is consumed afterwards and do not damage the consumer.
