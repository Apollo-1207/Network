**SCP-131, also known as “The Eyepods”** are a group of several similar anomalies, all of them with different personalities but with some common aspects. Their eyes do not blink and can also flash a low intensity light, which they seem to use to either communicate or to alert other instances/FPs of danger. They are only capable of answering Yes or No questions although they seem to understand human speech. It is recommended to talk to SCP-131 instances with simple phrases for a better response. Some instances seem to bond with humans more easily and these bonds may reach a point where SCP-131 feels empathy for said person or grief if he/she dies, thus it is not recommended to terminate CDs who bonded with SCP-131 when these same anomalies are nearby.

SCP-131 is a Safe Class Entity which is sentient and friendly towards our Personnel. It has free roam and can be seen in different colors, or in this case “Different Instances.”

Red can be Classified as a Leader for the Eyepods, it seems to have power over its compliances. Following any command of 131-A.although it wouldn’t be described as playful it will interact with Personnel once in sight, Other instances would assist Red, or follow it.

<summary>SCP-131-O | Orange</summary>

The orange instance of SCP 131 is out of all instances the most playful, this makes it the easiest instance to bond with (usually with compliments and playing), however, this comes at the cost of it sometimes struggling on certain tasks given by FP. Unlike the Purple instance, it seeks no harm with its playing and doesn’t seem to try to trick FP. It's rather hyperactive nature can cause it to flee from certain anomalous effects (SCP 1200’s for instance).

The Dark blue instance of SCP 131 shows some common behavior aspects with the orange instance, the difference being that dark blue is more reserved and curious regarding anomalies and new experiences. It will often interact with FP (by standing on someone's shoulders for instance) and, if bonded, it will be cooperative with one’s requests.

The purple instance of SCP 131 has shown to be the most “problematic” of all instances. It constantly tricks FP into traps and seems to find joy in doing so, thus making it somewhat hard to cooperate. As of now, it hasn't commit any physical harm to FP.

The Green instance of SCP-131 is the shyest of the 131 instances, it is friendly towards Foundation Personnel, but has a tendency to run away, or hide from them. When put into a dangerous situation, 131-G will usually flee as soon as possible, if it is unable to flee it may hide behind or under any solid object.
