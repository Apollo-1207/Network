Criminal Punishment describes the sanctions that are administered by an authoritative body to Foundation Personnel that violate Foundation Policy.


## Administrative blacklist
- Blacklisted from obtaining a supervisory or directorate role in any department, or the Foundation as a whole. 
    - Administrative Blacklist sentences can be permanent or temporary.

## Class E
- A restricted role designed to stop the progression of the violator. As a Class E, you will be restricted to a cell, unable to roam the site, unable to speak in all official channels, and unable to progress. 
    - Class E sentences can be permanent or temporary. 
    - Emergency Class E sentences can be issued by an authorized party. 

## Burn Notice
- The most severe punishment possible. All records of your time in the Foundation will be wiped. Official messages and record of progression internally will be removed and you will be permanently removed from official channels and games. In the eyes of the Foundation, you were never here.
