# Sublevel permissions

### Sublevel-4:
- Sublevel-4 is designed for most civil access for foundation personnel to operate around with. It being the civil sector of the Foundation will act as a safe environment for what is conducted upon this floor.
- The following precautions will be enacted to demonstrate a safe environment to allow for a civil sector:
  - Personnel must respect one another with no down-shaming, no disrespect or rude comments towards oneâ€™s manner.
  - Personnel may not contribute towards friendly fire unless in the act of self-defense. Cite towards the CoE for more information on self-defense or personnel engagement.
  - Personnel may not use provided gear inappropriately in regards to its true purpose.

### Sublevel-5: 
- Sublevel-5 designed in majority to contain Class - D personnel from the rest of the Foundation. Class - D personnel found outside of the CDC zone of Sublevel-5 without proper escorting units are to be terminated by combative personnel. If Class - D engage on civil personnel, the civil personnel have the right to act in self defense.

### Sublevel-6: 
- Sublevel-6, designed to contain all SCP anomalies with-in the facility, is the most secured floor from them all. Sublevel-6 is to only be accessed by combative personnel with reasonable intent. 
  - Reasonable intent includes actions of patrolling, responding to a potential call of trespassing, SCP recontainment, locating breached SCPs, and escorting personnel that have an assigned task or job to complete whilst on their divisional/departmental team. Foundation Personnel of security class zero to four may not enter even with combative escort.

### Notes
- Regardless of assigned Class, any zone that contains an SCP must have a combative escort with correct intent of entry.
- All personnel are disallowed from entering the Class - D containment zone except for any combative personnel, Security Class 4 and above, and Ethics Committee members.
- Personnel that fail to obtain the correct Security Class listed above entering, or disobeying a ranking structural law will be subject to punishment under code 2.0 - on-site policies.
- This section will be majorly updated the more the foundation expands
