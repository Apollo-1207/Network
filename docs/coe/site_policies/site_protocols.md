## Normal Activities 
The Normal Activities Protocol is the facility's neutral status that is in effect when no special operations or activities are currently happening on-site. When this protocol is active, Foundation Personnel are permitted to conduct their department duties, and other activities (Within the regulations of the CoE, and their Department Handbooks) freely. 

## Breach
- Protocol breach is announced when a SCP has breached containment on Sublevel-6. During a breach all on-site operations are to cease and Foundation Personnel and civil departments are to proceed to Sublevel-4, where SD will be waiting to close the Sublevel blast door. Once the blast door is closed, it will not reopen until the breach has been contained or MTF requests it to be opened.
- On-site activities (Tests, checkups, interviews, etc) are to be suspended immediately. All participants of the activity, the host, spectators, Class-D, combative escort, are to proceed to Sublevel-4 together. 


## Raid
- This Protocol is only activated when hostile forces are currently raiding and attacking the Facility. When this protocol is activated, on-site activities are suspended, and civil personnel are to report to the civil sector. Combative personnel are to follow [raid protocols] as outlined in their Department Handbook. 

## Riot 
- Tier I
  - Tier I riots will be announced when the Class-D Containment has become unstable and additional combative support is required. Civil Department Personnel, and Foundation Personnel are permitted to remain on Sublevel-5.
- Tier II
  - Tier II riots will be announced when the Class-D Containment zone has been lost, and the Security Response Unit has arrived and are assisting security personnel. Civil Department Personnel, and Foundation Personnel are not permitted to remain on Sublevel-5.
- Tier III
  - Tier II riots are announced when the riot has spread across multiple Sublevels and is no longer contained on Sublevel-5. The Security Department will cancel any on-going site activities and escort all parties of the activity; host, spectators, and Class-D, to Sublevel-4. 

## Lethal gas
This protocol is used as a last resort if a Tier III riot has been prolonged for 20+ minutes. Personnel are to equip themselves with the publicly provided gas masks and are to remain on Sublevel-4 behind the blast door.

## Blackout 
This protocol is only to be initiated by foundation senior command when deemed necessary.
