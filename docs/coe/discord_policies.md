## Preface

- All members and participants of the Discord server *must* follow these policies
    - Only members of High Command are exempt to some of these rules
- Enforcement of these policies is given to the Community Moderation Team and Administration Team
- In the event of a rule violation, depending on the severity, Foundation Personnel may also receive further punishment within their department(s) if seen as necessary

## Section A | General Rules

- Users should behave in a respectful and calm manner
    - Acts of rudeness, prejudice, discrimination and toxicity are **not** tolerated
- Users should remain within [Discord's Terms of Service](https://discord.com/tos) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines)
    - Violators will be banned immediately and reported to Discord Trust & Safety
        - Addendum :- Users can be punished for ToS violations that occured anywhere on the platform, not just in SCP-F servers.
- Profile content must be completely safe-for-work
    - This disallows any sexual content and the like in profile pictures, about me's and statuses
- Dangerous or illegal content is forbidden
    - Do not post or promote malware, doxing, phishing, leaking, pirated content or anything of the sort
- Do not advertise external communities
    - You may not advertise external communities through our group - this includes in the DMs of our members
    - If you are visible on the memberlist (within atleast 2 pages), you may not have advertisements in your status
- Do not attack a moderator's decision
    - Moderation staff reserve the right to hand out punishments to those they feel have violated these policies. If you wish to make a complaint against a moderator
    or one of their decisions, please do so in the Lead Moderator's DMs instead of publicly calling them out or flaming them.

## Section B | Chat-specific Rules

- All topics should be completely safe-for-work (SFW)
    - Not-safe-for-work (NSFW) themes should not be discussed
        - This includes any sort of sexual comments of any nature
- Content should stay on-topic in their respective channels
    - For example, only group-related content should be discussed in **#related_chat**
    - If a channel has a format in place, use it - do not deviate from it
- Be nice to other users
    - Most of all, our server is meant to be an inclusive place for everyone to enjoy the SCP genre. Make an effort to be welcoming to new people, and treat others how you would like to be treated yourself
- Speak English only
    - This group is English-based, therefore we request that all users speak English to allow for easier and more effective moderation
- Refrain from spamming or flooding chat
    - This includes mic-spamming, making loud noises, using soundboards that are annoying/loud, pasting copypastas and messages with an unnecessary amount of characters which
    are designed to create a large gap in chat.
- Inciting drama, arguments or fueling either of these is prohibited
    - Take your drama to DMs - its not our job to facilitate it
- Distasteful themes and controversial topics should not be brought to the server
    - Topics and themes that are not appropriate for younger audiences or generally shouldn't be discussed are disallowed
    - Generally controversial topics should not be discussed, this includes religion, politics and things that may cause polarising views
- Do not mislead users
    - If a user has a question, refrain from purposefully trolling or misleading them. If you do not know the answer, do not reply
## Section C | Miscellaneous

- Items that are restricted should not be "leaked"
    - Examples include privileged documents, messages, screenshots and others
    - This also includes exclusive teasers given to supporters and boosters
    - Another thing this includes is early access to in-game content
